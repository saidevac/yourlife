## App Controls

- **Screenshot Button**: This button allows you to capture the current view of your timeline. It is located at the top right corner of the screen.

- **Add New Activities**: Users can easily add new activities to their timeline. This feature allows you to visualize significant events and milestones in your life, helping you plan and reflect on your journey.

- **Visualize Remaining Lifetime**: The application dynamically updates the grid to show your remaining lifetime visually, making it easier to prioritize what matters most to you.
